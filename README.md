I built this game for an interview at a game studio - their "engineering test" was basically "make a game with the following required elements". I think I avoided their intentions a bit because I approached it like a game jam instead of a test, and tried to make a good game instead of ticking all the boxes.

Here's the code for it - enjoy!
